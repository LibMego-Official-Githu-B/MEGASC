this is how MEGASC work, let's choose the word "hi" to encrypt,
and choose "ab" as the passphrase, and "hi" in ASCII is 104 (h) & 105 (i) and 
combining them as strings will make it 104105 and doing the same thing to our passphrase
which is "ab" which will be 9798, and now we'll multiply the ASCII Values of the pp (passphrase) with pt (plain text)
and 104105 * (this is the multiply symbol) 9798 equals to 1020020790, and we'll choose nk (numerical key),
let's choose 3 as our nk, and choose 8 as our OOM number (OOM: Order of magnitude),
we will multiply or nk with our OOM number which and that will be 3 * 8 which equals to 24,
and we'll multiply 24 with that big number, and that will be 1020020790 * 24 and that equals to 24480498960.
and it's it, Hi is the plain text, 24480498960 is the cypher text, we encrypt "hi" securely.
the nk and pp act as private keys, just like in normal encryption methods, and OOM can be brute-forced
but nk and pp can't be brute-forced if they long, even a little bit, a pp of "passo" will be infeasible
to brute-forced, and just like any normal encryption method but MEGASC made easier for beginners
